# Hello User

This project provides a simple RESTful API greeting service. The service calculates the number of days left to the user's next birthday.

The service is built using Python and the FastAPI framework. Uses Alembic for database migration, Pydantic for data validation and SQLModel for database interactions.  

## Features

- **Simple Greeting**: Enter username to get a personalized greeting.
- **Birthday Countdown**: Provides the days left for the user's birthday.
- **Data Validation**: Utilizes FastAPI's request validation to ensure correct input format.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL for persistent data storage.



## How it works

1. The user can make a `GET` request to `/hello/{username}` to get a personalized greeting.
2. To update or add their birthday, the user can make a `PUT` request to `/hello/{username}` with their date of birth in the request body.



Interactive API documentation and OpenAPI spec are available at ` http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` and ` http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` once you run the application.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9
* MySQL
* Docker
* Google Cloud Platform Account (For cloud deployment)

## Repo Structure

This repository is structured as follows

* **app** - folder contains the source code for the API service implemented using FastAPI framework.
  * **tests** - folder under app contains the unit tests for the project
  * **migrations** - contains the versioned database initialisation scripts using Alembic.
* **docker** - contains the docker file required to build the image for local development and production deployment.
* **iac** - contains the Terraform code to deploy the service to Google Cloud Platform using CloudRun, CloudSQL and Cloud LoadBalancer. 
* **.github/workflows** - directory contains the github action definitions to build and deploy the service using Google Container Registry and Terraform.

## Local Development

### Running in Host machine

1. Clone the repository
   ```shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:dhiva/hello-user.git
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment within the project directory.

   ```shell
   $ cd ./app
   $ python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment in the project.

   ```shell
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install framework dependencies.

   ```shell
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the web server locally
   ```shell
   $ export DATABASE_URL="mysql+aiomysql://root:password@localhost:3306/testdb"
   # Run the database migration to create application tables in the database
   $ alembic upgrade head 
   # Initiate the webserver with hot reload for local development
   $ uvicorn main:api --reload
   ```

   

### Running in Docker

This project contains docker-compose to enable quick setup of local development environment

1. Build the docker image
   ```shell
   $ docker-compose build
   ```
2. Run the docker stack
   ```shell
   # Run the below command to initiate the containers in detached mode
   $ docker-compose up -d
   # or to view the logs for the service run the following command without the flag
   $ docker-compose up
   ```
3. On the initial run, you need to execute the database migrations script to create the necessary tables in the database.
   ```shell
   $ docker-compose exec fastapi-app alembic upgrade head 
   ```
4. The unit tests for APIs can be run using the following command
   ```shell
   $ docker-compose exec fastapi-app pytest -s -v
   ```

5. When the datamodel is updated, new database migration revisions can be autogenerated using alembic.
   ```shell
   $ docker-compose exec fastapi-app alembic revision --autogenerate -m "revision comment" 
   ```

   

## System Design

![gcp-infra-design](doc/gcp-infra-design.png "GCP System Design")

### Overview

The service and architectural decisions and configurations are made to deploy the hello user service on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The service is designed to be highly available, secure, and scalable, with a focus on automated deployment and centralized management.

### Core Components

- **API Service**: The FastAPI-based Hello User Service serves as the primary API interface. It is containerized and deployed on Google Cloud Run for easy scaling and high availability.
- **Backend Storage**: Google CloudSQL serves as the backend relational database for the service, providing persistent storage, backup, and failover capabilities.
- **Load Balancer**: A Google Cloud Load Balancer is used to manage incoming traffic, distribute loads across multiple instances of the service, and provide SSL termination.

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Containerization**: The FastAPI application is containerized using Docker for consistent and isolated runs.
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Upon updates to the Git repository, the Docker image is pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR) and then deployed to Cloud Run instances using Github Actions.
3. **Database Migrations**: Managed through Cloud Run Jobs, ensuring schema consistency with every new release. During each deployment, a new CloudRun Job service is initiated to complete the database migration.
4. **Load Balancing**: Traffic is routed through Google Cloud Load Balancer, which performs health checks and routes traffic to the most suitable instance.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated with Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging for real-time analytics and insights.

### Security Measures

- SSL for encrypted data in transit
- IAM roles and permissions to limit database and service access
- Data encryption at rest in CloudSQL

### Deployment Strategy
